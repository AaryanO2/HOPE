But, most people have more than one problem in their lives and more often than not,\\xa0 people have numerous significant stressors in their lives.\\xa0 Let\\'s face it, life can be complicated! Therapists are completely ready and equipped to handle all of the issues small or large that a client presents in session. Most therapists over the first couple of sessions will help you prioritize the issues you are facing so that you start addressing the issues that are causing you the most distress.\\xa0 You can never have too many issues to address in counseling.\\xa0 All of the issues you mention above can be successfully worked through in counseling.', metadata={'source': 'psychological_conversations.csv', 'row': 0})"
